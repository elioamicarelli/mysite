Welcome! I'm an **Applied Statistician** specialised in **Experimentation**, **Causal Inference**, and their interaction with **Machine Learning**. I'm also a practitioner of all-things-statistical-simulations and a Data Mining enthusiast. 
<br/>
<br/>
During the last 7 years I contributed and led Data Science projects across different industries such as **gaming**, **fashion retailing**, **consulting**, and **policy-oriented research**. I focused both on Business Products (major) and R\&D (minor).
<br/>
<br/>
In the **Blog** section of this website you will mainly find methodological notes about my Data Science specialisations. In the **Projects** section I collect some of my personal projects and ungated collaborations. Please visit the **Library** for a tentatively exhaustive list of references behind this website.
